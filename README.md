This code initializes a 1000x1000 matrix A with random values and performs LU decomposition using local memory.
The kernel function LU_decomposition uses shared memory to store a portion of the input matrix and performs the necessary calculations in parallel.
The resulting lower and upper triangular matrices L and U are stored in global memory and copied back to the host for further processing if necessary
